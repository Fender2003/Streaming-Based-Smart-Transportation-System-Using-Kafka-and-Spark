# 🚦 Streaming-Based Smart Transportation System Using Kafka and Spark

A real-time, cloud-native smart transportation system that ingests, processes, and stores data from multiple IoT sources using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, AWS S3, and AWS Glue.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Apache Kafka** – Real-time streaming data ingestion  
- **Apache Spark (PySpark)** – Distributed data processing  
- **AWS S3** – Scalable cloud storage for raw and processed data  
- **AWS Glue** – ETL operations and data catalog management  

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-time smart transportation infrastructure that processes IoT data streams from:

- 🚗 **Vehicles**
- 📍 **GPS Devices**
- ☁️ **Weather Sensors**
- 📷 **Camera Feeds**

### 🔧 How It Works

1. **Streaming with Kafka**  
   IoT devices continuously stream data into Apache Kafka topics.

2. **Processing with Spark**  
   Apache Spark (running on a cluster with Master and Worker nodes) consumes the data from Kafka and performs real-time transformations and analytics.

3. **Storage with AWS S3**  
   - Raw data is stored in designated S3 buckets.  
   - Processed data is also saved in S3 for further analysis or archival.

4. **ETL with AWS Glue**  
   - AWS Glue jobs perform Extract, Transform, Load operations.  
   - The Glue Data Catalog keeps track of the schema and metadata for efficient querying and data lake integration.
